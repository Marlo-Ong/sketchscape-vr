# Sketchscape VR
Sketchscape is a distraction-free, fully-customizable immersive sim that plaecs you in a virtual world to draw anything you can imagine.
Sketchscape:
- ignites inspiration with a wide range of drawing prompts
- provides users with customizable environments
- challenges users with an optional timed game mode
- relaxes users with a freeform mode for recreational fun

## Background
- The user is placed in a stationary virtual environment.
- There are no methods of locomotion, since this experience is meant to be played standing in one spot.
- The user will use the controllers to simulate a paint brush and "paint" onto a canvas.

## Features
- Immersive audio and haptic feedback while drawing
- Alter your brush size and color while you draw
- Timed game mode with dozens of unique art prompts
- Change your environment to options such as a beach, forest, winter cabin, and more
- Move your canvas and objects in the scene to achieve your perfect view
- Download and save your drawing into a file on the headset!

## Controls
When in the scene, you can look at the controllers to see what each control does. You can also open the main menu to view the controls.
Note: This app is meant to be played on a compatible VR headset, and was tested on the Oculus Meta Quest 2.

- Use the **VR headset** to look around in the virtual environment.
- Tap the **left thumbstick** up/down on the left controller to increase/decrease your brush **size**.
- Tap the **right thumbstick** up/down on the right controller to increase/decrease your brush **color**.
- Tap the **primary trigger** on either controller to click and navigate any in-game UI.
- Point and hold the **primary trigger** on either controller at the canvas to draw.
- Point and hold the **secondary trigger** on either controller to grab and move any interactible object, including the canvas.
